<h1>Exploring the Bytes: A Journey into File Signatures</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on digital forensics, where you analyze file signatures, or "magic numbers," to help identify file formats and ensure data integrity. Using the table from Gary Kessler's website, you'll be comparing the file signatures of JPG and GIF files with the xxd tool to visualize the hexadecimal data and match them against the standard signatures of these file types. The purpose of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of how file types are identified, how this process can aid in verifying file authenticity, and how forensics tools can use this method to spot tampered or suspicious files.

A key part of the project is manipulating file signatures by echoing forged signatures into files, allowing you to create fake files that mimic real formats. This exercise allows you to explore how altering file signatures impacts file type identification, helping you understand how manipulation of signatures can mislead or confuse detection methods. It's a valuable skill set for investigators dealing with file misidentification or potential malware, as tampered or falsely identified files often raise flags during forensic investigations.
